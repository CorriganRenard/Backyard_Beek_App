# Backyard_Beek_App

An application to track bee hives for backyard beekeepers.

This is the preliminary skeleton. 

start from command line:

mkdir [directory]
cd [directory]
git clone [git repo url]
cd Backyard_Beek_App
npm install
npm start -s

Thanks to Cory House whose react/redux layout I used to get started.
